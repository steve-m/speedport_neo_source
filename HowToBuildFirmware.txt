#

1)Background
Please make sure base on ubuntu 10.04 to setup environment. And already finished "HowToBuildToolchain.txt"

1-1)Install Software
	libtool (apt-get install libtool)
	flex (apt-get install flex)

1-2)Do not use root to build
    Make sure /bin/sh is link to bash not dash(ln -sf /bin/bash /bin/sh)
    (Note: it is different from toolchain build)
    (PS: build user has to be logout and login since sometimes i found system "export" is unexpected)
    
2)Compile Firmware image

2-2)Where to get firmware image file?
    if you built firmware successfully, get the image here: Result/090128.x.x.xxx.x.img 
    (x.x.xxx.x such as 2.0.001.0, not a static value).
