                DynIP Client for Unix Installtion           Dec, 1999


To create the DynIP client binaries for your operating system
follow these steps:

(1) Run the Configure script to create the Makefile and build the
    program executables.  The script will display a list of known systems
    and ask for the type of system if one is not provided on the command
    line.  For instance, if you are running a Linux system, type:

		./Configure linux

    To see the current known list, type

                ./Configure

(2) type ``make install'' to install the binaries in your
    installtion directory. You must have write priviliges
    in this directory.  The installation directory defaults to
    /usr/local/bin.

(3) type ``make man'' to copy the man pages to the system man 
    pages directory. You can then issue the ``man dynipadmin''
    command or ``man dynipclient'' command to get more information
    on how to use these programs.  The default man page directory
    is /usr/local/man/man1.

(4) Run the dynipadmin program to register your Internet Name.  See
    the man pages for more details.

The binaries have been succesfully compiled on the following operating
systems and hardware platforms:

	OS		OS version	Platform
