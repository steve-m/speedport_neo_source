DynIP(sm) Client V3.0 
DynIP, a division of CanWeb Internet Services Ltd.

Introduction 
=============

Dynip(sm) is a Dynamic IP Management System which allows Internet
hosts with dynamic IP addresses, such as dial-up users, to have a
permanent static Internet Name. Now, you  can register  your  own
personal  Internet Name  that  constantly  refers to your dynamic
IP  address, anywhere in the world!  Your Internet Name   becomes
integrated   into   the existing Domain Name  System (DNS) on the
Internet  within  seconds  of  your   name  registration!  People
can  refer  to  your machine by means of a simple static Internet
name, allowing you to make your  own unix  servers  available  to
the  public  by publishing your Internet name.  You  never  again
have to post your  dynamic  IP  address  to  a web page, or run a
silly finger server  informing others of your current IP address.
All you need to do is  run a very small client program  when  you
connect to the Internet and for  the  duration  of  your  connec-
tion.  It's that simple.  Try it free for 30 days!

Installation 
============

You must first build the DynIP registration  program -dynipadmin,
and  the  actual  DynIP  client  program -dynipclient  before you
can register and use your name.  After  extracting the files from
the  archive,  issue  the  'Configure'  command  from  the  shell
prompt,  then  'make  install man'. See the INSTALL file for more
details.

Operation 
=========

After the two programs have been  built, you  can  register  your
personal Internet Name using  the dynipadmin program. To register
your   Internet   Name,  the  following  minimum  parameters  are 
required:

dynipadmin -r <firstname> <lastname> <email address>  <host name>

For example,

 csh> ./dynipadmin -r Joe Bar foobar@myisp.com foobar

 Registering domain 'foobar'
 Registration key XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX
 Resolving host 'discovery.dynip.com'...Done.
 Connecting to discovery.dynip.com (204.225.44.10)...Connected.
 Negotiating protocol...Handshake OK
 Response received; closing
 Your domain has been registered
 You are now known to the Internet as 'foobar.dynip.com'

You  can  now run the dynipclient program by typing the following
command:

 csh> ./dynipclient
 csh>

Your Internet name has now been activated and any DNS lookups on
the domain name 'foobar.dynip.com' will automatically be resolved
to your current IP address. In order to ensure that your Internet
name  is  always  associated  with  your  current IP address, you 
*MUST* run the dynipclient program every time that you connect to
the Internet. The easiest is to include the  dynipclient  program
as part of your PPP login script.

When  you  want  to disconnect from the Internet, you need to run
the  dynipclient  program  with  the  -k   option   *before*  you
physically  disconnect  from  your  ISP.  You  can also issue the
following  command to accomplish the same:

     kill -HUP `cat dynipclient.pid`

     or

     dynipclient -k


Registration Key 
================

The very first time that  you register an Internet name, you will
be assigned a unique registration key. This key is  your  ``pass-
word'' that activates your Internet name.  If you  re-install the
DynIP client software, or change  to  another  operating  system,
make  sure  that  you always transfer your registration key. This
ensures     that   you  always  have access to   your  registered  
Internet.  You can set the registration key in the dynip.cfg file
by means  of  the  '-s'  option  in  the  dynipadmin program, but 
normally you do not need to set this.

Man Pages 
=========

To  install  the  man pages, run 'make man' from the shell prompt
or,  copy  dynipadmin.1  and  dynipclient.1  to   your  '/usr/lo-
cal/man/man1'  or '/usr/man/man1' directory. You will need to run
as root in order to make the man pages.


More Information 
================

For more information see the man pages for dynipadmin and  
dynipclient or visit our web site at http://www.dynip.com.

========
